That would be the longest losing streak since the 5-day stretch ending Feb. 25, which is just before the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns took hold; the shares have lost 4.9% during the current streak. The stock had been on a tear as investors viewed the streaming video giant as a beneficiary of stay-at-home measures implemented to thwart the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It had run up 52.0% from March 16 through May 15, while the S&P 500 had advanced 20.0%. Analyst Matthew Harrigan at Benchmark said in a note earlier this week, that he was keeping his sell rating on Netflix because he thought the stock was ""quite vulnerable to any prospective market rotation out of COVID-19 safe-haven names."" He was also concerned that increasing competition in the streaming space could curb investors' ""rampant enthusiasm"" for the stock."

June will see the final seasons of the ’90s revival comedy “Fuller House” (June 2), as well as the teen drama “13 Reasons Why” (June 5). Ryan Murphy’s dark election comedy “The Politician” (June 19) returns for a second season, “Queer Eye” (June 5) moves to Philadelphia for its fifth season of makeovers, the Peabody Award-winning comedy/news-analysis show “Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj” (June 7) is back for a sixth season, and the understated and sweet dating show “Dating Around” (June 12) returns for a second season, this time set in New Orleans. The highlight of the month for Netflix may be Spike Lee’s first direct-to-streaming film, “Da 5 Bloods” (June 12), as four African-American Vietnam vets return to that country in search of a fallen comrade’s body — and a stash of gold. On the lighter side, there’s also “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga” (June 26), a musical mocumentary starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as an Icelandic singing duo. Other potentially intriguing offerings include the spelling-bee documentary “Spelling the Dream” (June 3), the medical documentary set at a New York City hospital “Lenox Hill” (June 10) and the ridiculous game show “Floor Is Lava” (June 19), where teams navigate a room without touching the floor because, you guessed it — the floor is lava.

Will you be forced into a pay cut? Read these pros and cons before deciding,"Twitter, Square, Shopify and Facebook  employees were told they can work from home even after the pandemic ends. “As we’ve become accustomed to working outside the office, it’s become clear that we don’t need everyone to be physically present to do great work,” Lori Goler, vice president of  people at Facebook said in a post on Thursday  “From now on, we are moving toward making remote work a more permanent part of our culture.” Shopify Chief Executive Tobi Lutke echoed Facebook’s announcement tweeting later that day that “office centricity is over” and most workers should expect to permanently work from home well after the pandemic. Twitter, however, was the first major company to announce a permanent work-from-home option. “Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs,” states a Twitter post from May 12. The work-from-home options may not be applicable to or, indeed, welcomed by all workers. If you work at Facebook and you move to a cheaper city you may have to take a pay cut, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday. For instance, roles related to office security or in-office operations can only be performed in the office, a Square spokeswoman told MarketWatch. Similarly, a Twitter spokeswoman said that employees who work in data centers won’t be able to work remotely once it is safe for them to return to work. Other companies like Google +0.46%, Visa and American Express have gone ahead and told workers they continue to be working from home well into next year. There’s no word on whether they will allow workers to permanently work from home. “Visa continues to closely monitor COVID-19 and its impact globally, while prioritizing the health and well-being of our employees,” said Will Stickney, a Visa spokesman. “As a result, we expect a majority of Visa’s workforce will continue to work from home through the 2020 calendar year.” (American Express declined to comment. Google and Shopify did not respond to requests for comment.) Don’t miss:‘I was told I could never work remotely’: Before coronavirus, workers with disabilities say they implored employers to allow them to work from home Certainly, there are benefits to working from home — you don’t have to worry about getting caught in traffic and showing up late to a meeting. Perhaps your coworker who leaves the office microwave a mess or who tries to walk over others to get ahead will no longer come into the office. But that decision may come with some significant costs. Consider these pros and cons: Pro: You could save up to $5,000 in commuting costs  Depending on what state you’re from, you could spend between $2,000 and $5,000 a year on commuting, according to calculations by Business Insider based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. You could also save you a total of 9.4 days a year from the time spent commuting, according to an May survey of nearly 3,000 American workers published by Global Workplace Analytics, a San Diego-based workplace consultancy firm. That means you could wake up later, spend less on gasoline, said Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics. It may even make sense to get rid of your car altogether, she said. Lister said she sold her car after she began working from home years before coronavirus. She now shares one car with her husband. (To calculate the total amount of money you could save by teleworking check out this employee savings calculator) Con: You may end up having to pay for your own WiFi and electricity  Employees at Square and Facebook may not be compensated for work-related costs if they choose to work from home on a daily basis. (Both companies declined to comment.) Twitter employees, however, will be compensated for the cost of Wi-Fi and receive a stipend for their at-home office setup, a spokeswoman said. “The costs of potentially upgrading to speedier Wi-Fi, acquiring office supplies and setting up an ergonomic-friendly workspace could add up if your employer is unable to offer additional financial support,” said Sarah Stoddard, a Glassdoor career trends expert. But the amount you’re saving on commuting should make up for that cost, Lister added. Pro: You could move to a city where rent is cheaper  Typically non-remote workers live in areas close to where they work. That often means a high cost of living, especially in cities like New York or San Francisco. Even if you still plan on going into your office once a week, an hour drive may not be all the bad when you factor in how much you could save, Lister said. Your company, like Facebook, may insist you take a pay cut to compensate for that. Related: Work-from-home productivity pickup has tech CEOs predicting many employees will never come back to the office Con: You may miss out on brainstorming or a promotion  If you’re teleworking, it may be harder for you to impress your boss, which may mean losing out on a promotion, Stoddard said. But you can find new ways to demonstrate your involvement and impact at work if you choose to permanently work from home.  “Even minor tactics like turning on your video during virtual meetings, providing an additional perspective in email threads and delivering timely status reports to your manager can go a long way,” she said. Con: You may lose out on social aspects of work  Research shows that socialization at work can lead to a less stressful work environment. By working from home you may miss out on happy hours, birthday celebrations and casual one-on-one lunches with coworkers. There’s also a lot to be said for office banter and brainstorming over the water cooler, workplace consultants say, and you would be saved from the seemingly endless deluge of daily Slack messages."

The video posted to its German Instagram and Facebook accounts showed a pair of oversized white hands appearing to push and pull a black man away from a yellow VW Golf 8 car packed on a street. The Volkswagen advert was supposed to mimic popular social media videos that show one person appearing to be controlled by another like a puppet, but something was definitely lost in translation. What’s more, one of the white hands then flicked the black man into a cafe called “Petit Colon,” which translates into “Little Settler” from French to English, or “Little Colonist” from German to English, the BBC reported. German television also noted that the letters that start appearing on the screen afterward first spell out “neger” — which can be used as the German equivalent of the n-word — before merging into the slogan “Der Neue Golf,” or “The New Golf.” The online backlash was swift, with many on Twitter sharing saved clips and screenshots of the now-deleted ad, and calling out Volkswagen’s roots in the German Nazi party. The German auto maker originally responded that it was “surprised and shocked that our Instagram story could be so misunderstood” on Instagram, the BBC reported. But by Wednesday, it had pulled the ad, and issued a lengthy, formal apology where it admitted the spot was racist. “We posted a racist advertising video on Volkswagen’s Instagram channel,” the VW brand’s head of sales and marketing Jürgen Stackmann and group head of diversity Elke Heitmüller wrote in a statement posted on Twitter and shared on LinkedIn on Wednesday. “We understand the public outrage at this. Because we’re horrified, too.” “On behalf of Volkswagen AG, we apologize to the public at large for this film,” the statement as translated by Reuters continues. “And we apologize in particular to those who feel personally hurt by the racist content because of their own history.” Here it is in full: Volkswagen USA posted on its social media channels that the ad’s content was “unacceptable on many levels,” and that “the advertisement by our colleagues was in poor taste and not an accurate reflection of our views or values. We sincerely apologize to anyone offended and everyone who viewed.”"

The series is listed alongside content that Netflix licenses from other sources, as opposed to original content developed by Netflix. Netflix did not respond to a request for more information, and Cocomelon’s tight-lipped creator, Treasure Studio Inc., did not respond to an email seeking comment. Roku Inc. announced Tuesday that a Cocomelon channel debuted on its service, suggesting that Treasure Studio is moving Cocomelon beyond Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube, where it originally became famous for animated videos with catchy songs for preschoolers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the channel had 84.2 million YouTube subscribers and its videos had accumulated more than 62.3 billion views combined on that platform. Only two independent YouTube channels have more subscribers, according to SocialBlade, and both are from outside the U.S. — Indian music site T-Series and videogame streamer PewDiePie both have more than 100 million subscribers. Cocomelon is ranked second by video views overall to T-Series, according to SocialBlade. Just last week, Cocomelon became the first YouTube channel ever to surpass 1 billion views in a week, according to TubeFilter. Roku’s news release announcing the new Cocomelon channel on its service included a statement from Jay Jeon, the creator and founder of Treasure Studio. Jeon is famously secretive, and was only identified as the person behind Treasure Studio in a Bloomberg News article earlier this year, 14 years after he and his wife began posting videos to YouTube, which had not yet been acquired by Google when the channel launched. “At Cocomelon, we’re driven by being able to engage families with entertaining and educational content that makes universally relatable preschool moments fun,” Jeon said, later adding, “This partnership is an important component of our strategy to be everywhere our audience is today.” MarketWatch staff writers Jonathan Swartz and Mike Murphy contributed to this article."

The two-day Prime Day sales event is typically held in July, but surging demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic and strains on the e-commerce giant's warehouses have led to the postponement of the event, the Journal report said, citing people described as familiar with the matter. The company is now allowing unlimited shipments of nonessential goods to its warehouses, which suggests Amazon is now in position to process orders more quickly and create room for inventory, the report indicated. The stock rose 0.2% in morning trading. It has rallied 6% amid a six-day win streak through Wednesday's record close, and has gained in 12 of the previous 13 sessions. The stock has run up 35.4% in 2020, while the S&P 500 has slipped 8.2%."

In it, Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Satya Nadella laid out his vision for “empowering every developer.” His 20-minute speech was followed by a series of live and prerecorded tutorials on coding, cloud computing, and other geeky topics from TV-like studios on the Microsoft campus, buttressed by slick graphics and pretaped videos, all day and night. And all of it was free, with easy access to 509 sessions and documentation. The two-day conference had the look and feel of content-on-demand a la Netflix Inc. A week earlier, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang delivered a two-hour keynote at GTC Digital in nine 12-minute slices, based on topics ranging from autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence. The presentation, taped in Huang’s kitchen, attracted 4 million views. This year, 57,000 developers signed up to attend; last year, 10,000 physically attended the conference in San Jose, Calif. Such is the new world of tech conferences in the age of COVID-19. They’ve gone all-digital, like Build and GTC Digital, and may never be the same. Absent a vaccine, the days of thousands of people herded into hotel ballrooms and convention centers like cattle, sharing cabs and eating in cramped quarters, are gone. Far from crippling the tech industry, however, virtual shows could lead to democratization of what had once been an exclusive, pricey privilege for tech movers and shakers. In the new climate, consumers have free access to valuable technical content whenever they wish to view it. “This will definitely change the approach of tech conferences. Virtually, you can identify attendees online and track what they see,” Paddy Cosgrave, chief executive of the company that runs the Web Summit and Collision conferences, told MarketWatch in a phone interview Monday. The show, originally planned June 22-25 in Toronto, will go on as an all-digital event those days. “If the show is pure content and not networking, like an F8 or Build, you can upsell to them virtually,” he said. “F8, AWS, and Build are like infomercials, selling to an existing customer base.” “Without question it was a better experience: free, no red-eye flight, no hotel room charges, and better access to the Microsoft team,” Laron Walker, CEO of Mantisedu Inc., an Atlanta-based education hardware partner of Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “Last year, I paid several thousand dollars to attend, and if I was late for a session, I couldn’t rewind it. This year, I could.” Walker, 41, said he was able to view sessions at any time, pause them to take notes, and then pass them on to co-workers. He was also able to connect with Build speakers via LinkedIn and email because he had more information about them via their presentations. “This made me look at tech conferences in a whole new light,” he said. Developers conferences are as much an annual ritual in the tech industry as Apple Inc. product launches and gargantuan shows like CES and Mobile World Congress. All told, they set the narrative for developers and, eventually, consumers over the next year or two. May is usually the epicenter of such gatherings. Before COVID-19, executives, analysts, business partners, and the press had scheduled their travel schedules to attend Microsoft’s Build (May 19-21, in Seattle), Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s I/O summit (May 12-14, Mountain View, Calif.), and Facebook Inc.’s F8 (May 5-6, in San Jose). Two of those shows were dropped while a third will be vastly restructured. For example: Apple: “We are delivering WWDC 2020 this June in an innovative way to millions of developers around the world, bringing the entire developer community together with a new experience,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said in a statement May 5. “We look forward to sharing more details about WWDC20 with everyone as we get closer to this exciting event” on June 22. The event is free for all developers. Facebook: The company, which has vowed not to host events of more than 50 people until June 2021, is “still working through what F8 and more broadly what FB’s events/conference approach will be beyond June 2021,” a company spokesperson told MarketWatch. Google: Google canceled I/O altogether and declined to comment on the show next year. The show will go on, however, for Google Cloud Next ‘20, with more than 200 sessions over nine weeks, from July 14 through Sept. 8, a Google Cloud spokesperson told MarketWatch. Amazon: AWS Insights Online Conference is offering a free half-day “educational immersion” tutorial on media tech capabilities on May 28. The evolution of developer conferences was inevitable in an era of lightning-fast streaming services, content on demand, and videoconferencing. A developer in say, Spain, can binge-watch cloud-computing solutions on one channel while another in Brazil views an archived keynote speech at roughly the same time. If it sounds suspiciously like a viewing experience on Netflix or Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+, that is the goal, she and others say. Microsoft was already in the process of “re-imaging” how to connect more with developers to improve engagement, accessibility, resources, and content before COVID-19 — which accelerated its plan, Charlotte Yarkoni, corporate vice president of cloud and AI at Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “People don’t like watching something that requires you to sit for four hours; they prefer content when they choose to watch regardless of time zones,” said Yarkoni, who called first-day demand and interest of Build “unprecedented.” She said interest in the weeks leading up to the two-day conference signaled that Build would experience a bump. Traffic for Microsoft Learn, a learning-platform for technical content usually used by developers, was up 272% in April, year-over-year, she said. What is more, Microsoft now has more than 72 million monthly active users across its technical documentation and learning sites. Perhaps, another tech executive suggests, the preponderance of consumers using Zoom Video Communications Inc. has conditioned them to digest technical information online. “Business-to-business conferences like ours are dependent on people meeting in-person,” Okta Inc. CEO Todd McKinnon told MarketWatch in a phone interview. But his perception changed after this year’s edition of Oktane20 Live, an all-digital show in early April, drew record attendance. He’s now considering a permanent shift to a hybrid model of both in-person and digital attendees next year and beyond. “We had tons of leads and off-the-charts engagement with an all-digital format,” McKinnon said after 20,000 attended, compared with 6,000 a year ago. Nutanix Inc.’s Global .NEXT Digital Experience was to take place June 30-July 2 in Chicago. Now, it’s scheduled to be online in September. “COVID-19 has forced Nutanix to think outside the box,” Nutanix Inc. Chief Marketing Officer Ben Gibson told MarketWatch in an email. “Consumers can expect the same great content from our traditional in-person events but on a schedule that best suits them — from the comfort of their home office.” Before we write off the concept of the classic tech conference — even with the best of intentions and a treasure trove of content, there is no better way to network than in person, Collision’s Cosgrave points out. “Bigger conferences for meant for networking -- dinners, cocktails, late-night meetings,” he said. “The flurry of networking is the utility of conferences. Speakers and panels are an excuse to go.” “At the end of the day, we hope to be back in person in Toronto next year,” he said."

City’s iconic statue gets makeover in bid to lure auto maker,"TULSA, Okla.  — Tulsa’s iconic Golden Driller statue is joining the effort to lure auto maker Tesla to build its new U.S. assembly plant in Oklahoma’s second-largest city. The 75-foot tall, golden statue in the heart of the city is getting a makeover that includes a bright-red Tesla logo on its chest, a Tesla belt buckle and a mask to make the oil field worker resemble the company’s CEO Elon Musk. City officials unveiled the new look at a press conference Wednesday afternoon at the Tulsa Expo Center, where dozens of Tesla electric cars were parked outside a building that hosted the international petroleum trade show for years. “I think it’s pretty cool,” said Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, standing beneath the mammoth statue. “It’s a way of showing how we want to roll out the red carpet and partner with this company.” The company has reportedly picked Tulsa and Austin, Texas, as finalists for its new factory that is expected to employ more than 10,000 people. No timeline for a decision has been announced. Oklahoma touts its low tax rates and cost of living, particularly its low utility costs, when trying to woo businesses from other states. An auto manufacturer would qualify for numerous tax incentives, including a Quality Jobs program that provides cash rebates to companies that create good-paying jobs, a sales tax exemption that covers purchases of machinery and equipment, and a five-year property tax exemption. The state also has a specific automotive engineer tax credit that provides a corporate income tax credit of up to 10% of the engineer’s salary, and a $5,000 annual income tax credit to the worker."

Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi dropped the hammer for the second time in less than two weeks Monday. In a memo to employees, he announced 3,000 job cuts on top of 3,700 already disclosed. This represents about a fourth of Uber’s workforce. The end game, in the opinion of two analyst research notes, is more centralized operations and structure, with less pricey long-term investments. See also: Uber shares rise 3.6% on latest layoff news “Uber continues to mature, with a more focused scope of operations and fewer non-core endeavors,” BofA Securities analyst Justin Post wrote in a note Tuesday. “We would not be surprised if Uber is looking at strategic options for Freight, despite costs cuts being still focused on selected growth initiatives. Actions such as incorporating public transit in the mobility app, and expanding Eats to ‘Delivery’ including Grocery and Direct delivery.” Post, who maintains a buy rating and price target of $42, sees “some upside potential” with 6,700 jobs eliminated and the shuttering of 45 Uber facilities. “We think these changes underscore a more focused and mature Uber and will likely result in an accelerated path to break-even if end markets recover,” he wrote. Uber’s race to profitability should occur next year as it and other gig-economy players such as Lyft Inc. and Airbnb Inc. pare their workforces, notes CFRA analyst Angelo Zino. “We applaud [the cost savings] as it will allow the Rides segment to be profitable at a much lower run rate,” Zino said in a note Monday that maintains a buy rating on Uber stock. “We anticipate a tempered recovery in the ridesharing market without a vaccine for Covid-19, with the segment unlikely seeing previous peak volume over the next 2 years. “That said, we see UBER being profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by the second half of ‘21. We believe the moves (includes office reductions) will allow UBER’s cost structure to become more variable.” Uber shares, which inched down 0.6% in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, are up 12.4% this year. The broader S&P 500 index has declined 9.5% in 2020."

The event is free for all developers. Facebook: The company, which has vowed not to host events of more than 50 people until June 2021, is “still working through what F8 and more broadly what FB’s events/conference approach will be beyond June 2021,” a company spokesperson told MarketWatch. Google: Google canceled I/O altogether and declined to comment on the show next year. The show will go on, however, for Google Cloud Next ‘20, with more than 200 sessions over nine weeks, from July 14 through Sept. 8, a Google Cloud spokesperson told MarketWatch. Amazon: AWS Insights Online Conference is offering a free half-day “educational immersion” tutorial on media tech capabilities on May 28. The evolution of developer conferences was inevitable in an era of lightning-fast streaming services, content on demand, and videoconferencing. A developer in say, Spain, can binge-watch cloud-computing solutions on one channel while another in Brazil views an archived keynote speech at roughly the same time. If it sounds suspiciously like a viewing experience on Netflix or Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+, that is the goal, she and others say. Microsoft was already in the process of “re-imaging” how to connect more with developers to improve engagement, accessibility, resources, and content before COVID-19 — which accelerated its plan, Charlotte Yarkoni, corporate vice president of cloud and AI at Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “People don’t like watching something that requires you to sit for four hours; they prefer content when they choose to watch regardless of time zones,” said Yarkoni, who called first-day demand and interest of Build “unprecedented.” She said interest in the weeks leading up to the two-day conference signaled that Build would experience a bump. Traffic for Microsoft Learn, a learning-platform for technical content usually used by developers, was up 272% in April, year-over-year, she said. What is more, Microsoft now has more than 72 million monthly active users across its technical documentation and learning sites. Perhaps, another tech executive suggests, the preponderance of consumers using Zoom Video Communications Inc. has conditioned them to digest technical information online. “Business-to-business conferences like ours are dependent on people meeting in-person,” Okta Inc. CEO Todd McKinnon told MarketWatch in a phone interview. But his perception changed after this year’s edition of Oktane20 Live, an all-digital show in early April, drew record attendance. He’s now considering a permanent shift to a hybrid model of both in-person and digital attendees next year and beyond. “We had tons of leads and off-the-charts engagement with an all-digital format,” McKinnon said after 20,000 attended, compared with 6,000 a year ago. Nutanix Inc.’s Global .NEXT Digital Experience was to take place June 30-July 2 in Chicago. Now, it’s scheduled to be online in September. “COVID-19 has forced Nutanix to think outside the box,” Nutanix Inc. Chief Marketing Officer Ben Gibson told MarketWatch in an email. “Consumers can expect the same great content from our traditional in-person events but on a schedule that best suits them — from the comfort of their home office.” Before we write off the concept of the classic tech conference — even with the best of intentions and a treasure trove of content, there is no better way to network than in person, Collision’s Cosgrave points out. “Bigger conferences for meant for networking -- dinners, cocktails, late-night meetings,” he said. “The flurry of networking is the utility of conferences. Speakers and panels are an excuse to go.” “At the end of the day, we hope to be back in person in Toronto next year,” he said."
